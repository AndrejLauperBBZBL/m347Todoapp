## Overview
The following repository is a simple `todo` API built in NodeJS using the Express framework.

This repo currently serves two purposes:

1. Example application using Codeship Pro
2. A [Todo Backend]() community project.  

The following `README` will be a guide to run this project locally, use Codeship for testing and deployments, and ultimately deliver the code to Heroku.

Be sure to star/watch this repo to stay up-to-date with any changes. If you have any questions or suggestions regarding this example , please submit an [issue here]().

## Getting Started
There are a few resources to make sure you have available during this guide.

1. A public, cloud based [Github](https://github.com/join)/[Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in#register)/[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/account/signup/) Account
  + These must be cloud based, and not on your own servers.
2. [Heroku](https://signup.heroku.com/) Account
3. [Codeship](https://app.codeship.com/registrations/new) Account

Signup for each of these is free, and should only take you a few minutes if you don't already have one.  You can use your current accounts if you already have one available.

Once you have your accounts ready to go, you can move on to the next step.
